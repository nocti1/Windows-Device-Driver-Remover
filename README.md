# Windows Device Driver Remover
This PowerShell script helps remove devices and/or drivers which are found by a keyword.
It can be useful to target all devices by keyword programatically if you have many copies of the same device.

### Todo:
- Update script to accept a variable (keyword) switch as an input, rather than editing the script to put in your keyword
- Add no confirmation/force switch
- Add "what if"/discovery mode switch
